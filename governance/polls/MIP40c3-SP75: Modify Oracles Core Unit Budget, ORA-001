# Ratification Poll for Modify Oracle Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP75)- August 8, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the MakerDAO mandated actors. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 8 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is an instant-runoff vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The Oracle Core Unit (ORA-001, aka OCU) is responsible for R&D of the Oracle Protocol. Oracles are a critical component of securing the Maker Protocol. The Oracles protect the solvency of the Maker Protocol by ensuring Dai in circulation are sufficiently collateralized, enabling liquidations when the value of collateral declines. Oracles act as the consensus mechanism for the Maker Teleport bridges which are critical for scaling Dai in a multi-chain world. The Oracle Core Unit is essential to ensure the Oracle Protocol can evolve in a secure and scalable manner to meet the ever-growing demands of the Maker Protocol. This budget represents the resources needed to employ the exceptional talent to take on this critical responsibility. This budget can be reviewed [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp75-modify-oracles-core-unit-budget-ora-001/16397//).

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP40c3-SP75 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol by ranking their support of the following options:

This MIP40c3 subproposal provides the following options, fully described above, for ranked-choice voting:

A: Approve existing budget (2021-2022) (Business as usual)
B: Approve proposed budget (2022-2023) (Reduced budget exempt from further cuts for 12 months)
C: Reject budget
D: Abstain

## Outcomes

**This poll implements a Minimum Positive Participation value. The Minimum Positive Participation is currently set to 10,000 MKR.**

If the votes for Option A, Option B, Option C, or Option D achieve a majority AND the votes for the winning option exceed 10,000 MKR, then the following actions will be taken:

* The MIP Editors will mark the proposal Accepted and the Governance Facilitators will confirm its passage on the Governance and Risk call on Thursday, August 25.
* Any further work required to implement the proposal will be tasked to the relevant Core Units.
Otherwise, this proposal will be marked as rejected per MIP51.
